## Neural Networks for MNIST
In this problem you will build 2 models and train them on MNIST dataset.
Start by having a look at [main.py](./main.py) file.
You will see that there are two classes (`F1` and `F2`) as well as two functions (`train` and `main`) that you have to implement.
We recommend implementing them in order of `F1`, `F2`, `train` and `main`.

To run the problem do: `python homeworks/neural_network_mnist/main.py` from the root directory of provided zip file, and then save and add the plots to your written submission.

Two things to note:
    1. Do not use anything from torch.nn other than what is already imported.
    2. There are no public tests for this problem due to number of possible implementations.
        You can
    3. You can find that you are not using everything imported in the `main.py` file.
        It is ok, not everything is necessary to finish the problem.
        However, they might make your code easier to read and debug.
