## Ridge Regression
In this problem you will implement a multi-class classifier using ridge regression.
There are 3 functions `train`, `predict` and `one_hot` all of which are unit tested and you can do them in any order. The file in which you will find these functions is: [`ridge_regression.py`](./ridge_regression.py).

After finishing assignment run the code (for example `python homeworks/ridge_regression_mnist/ridge_regression.py`) and in `.pdf` submit train and testing errors that got printed out.
