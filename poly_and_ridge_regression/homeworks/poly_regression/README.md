## Poly Regression
In this problem you will implement a polynomial regression. It is a simple extension to linear regression, but with polynomials of original feature appended to the data before it's passed into the model.

You will implement 5 functions in [`poly_regression/polyreg.py`](./polyreg.py) file: `__init__` (constructor), `predict`, `polyfeatures`, `fit`, `mean_squared_error` and `learningCurve`. All functions but `learningCurve` are unit tested. However, we do advise you to finish `polyfeatures` before `fit` and `fit` before `predict`.


After finishing assignment there are two scripts to run.
For the first problem run `plot_polyreg_univariate.py` (for example `python homeworks/poly_regression/plot_polyreg_univariate.py`) and in `.pdf` submit plot generated by this script.
For the second problem run `plot_polyreg_learningCurve.py` (for example `python homeworks/poly_regression/plot_polyreg_learningCurve.py`) and in `.pdf` submit plot generated by this script.
