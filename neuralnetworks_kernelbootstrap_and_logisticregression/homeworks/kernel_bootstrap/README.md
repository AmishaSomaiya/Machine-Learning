## Kernels & Bootstrap
In this problem you will implement two kernels: Polynomial and Radial Basis Function (RBF).
For each one you will:
    1. Search with cross-validation to find optimal parameters
    2. Plot trained function
    3. Plot trained function's 5th and 95th percentiles obtained using bootstrap.

Lastly you will compare errors of RBF and polynomial kernels using bootstrap, and discuss whether one is better or not.

We recommend implementing functions in order they are provided in a file.
The only exception is that you should also modify `main` function as you keep implementing other functions and solving parts A, B and C.
Part D of the problem can be solved by putting A, B and C in a for-loop, while part E is quite similar to bootstrap function.

After finishing assignment run the code (for example `python homeworks/kernel_bootstrap/main.py`) and in `.pdf` submit plots that you have generated.
