## K Means
In this problem you will implement a K Means clustering algorithm and run in on MNIST dataset.
There are 5 functions to implement total: 4 in [`k_means.py`](./k_means.py) and 1 in [`main.py`](./main.py).
You should start with functions in `k_means.py`, namely both of the sub-routines: `calculate_centers` and `cluster_data`.
Then you should implement `calculate_error` and `lloyd_algorithm`.
Lastly you should go to `main` function in `main.py` file and implement it using functions you've implemented before.

After finishing assignment run the code (for example `python homeworks/k_means/main.py`) and in `.pdf` submit plots that you have generated.

Note that this problem can run for a while, so it is important to optimize your code.
