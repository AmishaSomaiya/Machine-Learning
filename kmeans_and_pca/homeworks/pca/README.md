## PCA
In this problem you will use explore how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) behavior changes as the expression because more and more low-dimensional.

You will implement 4 functions in [main.py](./main.py) file.
We suggest that you start with either `calculate_eigen` or `reconstruct_demean` functions.
Once you are finished with them you can implement `reconstruction_error`, and then `main` function.

After you have implemented above functions. Run the [main.py](./main.py) script (For example `python homeworks/pca/main.py`) and submit plots that you have generated in .pdf format.

Note that in this problem you will not need to implement PCA from scratch. You can use numpy built-in functions.
