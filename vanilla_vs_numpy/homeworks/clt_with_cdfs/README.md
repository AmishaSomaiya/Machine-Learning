# HW0

## Setup

**Before you start working on any problem** make sure you follow instructions of setting up environment. You can find them in [root folder README](../../README.md). If you have any problems or questions about installing conda, whether you should use anaconda vs miniconda, why are we even using conda etc. feel free to reach out to TAs, stack overflow or Google.

Remaining instructions for this problem are written assuming that you have successfully setup environment `cse446`, installed all packages in it (including `pip install -e .`) and have activated it (`conda activate cse446`).

## Central Limit Theorem (CLT) with CDFs

In this problem you will explore implementation of CLT on CDF of random variables.
To start with this problem look at [`clt_with_cdfs.py`](./clt_with_cdfs.py), and fill in all of the `#TODO:` items.

After you are done with this run the file (e.g. from root as above run `python homeworks/clt_with_cdfs/clt_with_cdfs.py`) and add plot to a your written submission.

While the problem itself is not hard we ask you to study the code and ask any questions (on discussion board, OH, section etc.) you have about it. It might feel like a tedious task now but it might save you a lot of time later in the quarter.
